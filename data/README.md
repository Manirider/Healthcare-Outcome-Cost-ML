# Data

## raw/

`synthetic_healthcare.csv` — the original generated dataset (8,000 patients, 17 features). Contains intentional missing values and outliers to simulate realistic clinical data collection.

Generated by `src/generate_data.py`.

## processed/

`synthetic_healthcare_engineered.csv` — cleaned and feature-engineered version. Missing values imputed with MICE, outliers Winsorized to clinical bounds, and 8 engineered features added.

The raw data is treated as read-only. All transformations produce new files in `processed/`.
